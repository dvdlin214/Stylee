Stylee is Social Network Platform which allows user to organize and socialize around your fashion style and clothing. 

This is NOT a school project but a project for my interest. Which means,,, I literally built everything on my own. It was a lot of fun and I just enjoyed the learning process throughout.

## Story
**I was thinking about what will be the next Facebook or Instagram in next 4 years.** Every day before I went to bed, I wrote down at least one idea of the next social network service or next generation of mobile apps would be. And I thought I'd make an app for myself. I wasn't very well dressed, so I thought I'd make an app that would help me dress well. 

In short this took me to...

- Wrote **65+ APIs** and **56+ pages**(screens) in **4 months**
- Finished **3 nanodegrees** (Udacity) and **9** Udemy courses in **8 months**
- Attended **3 hackathon**, and met brilliant people who have same interest as mine (Met entrepreneurs, designers and software engineers).
- Got StackOverflow **600+ reputation** (I'm not sure if this is something that I should be proud of, but I like it)
- Read bunch of deep learning papers (7 papers?; only 3 of them were useful) for Regional Convolutional Neural Network. (When I built this app, R-CNN wasn't popular and still under a research. It was often called as 'Darknet')

## Interviews, Business Model, UI/UX, Tech Stack Research

I interviewed 13 people for idea pitching and 3 people for UI testing.

**ORM Basic + Flow**

**Finalized Tech Stacks**
 
- Django / Phython
- React/Redux/JavaScript/react-navigation/ 
- Tensorflow for R-CNN training
- OpenCV2
- getStream.io for Newsfeed and Notification (Got this idea from Hackerthon - Thanks Kyung-Hoon)

### Final Page Hirearchy
Total 56 screens Main tree

```
Newsfeed Page: Newsfeed Main, Weekly Top 100 page
Style page: Style page, Category page, Bookmark page
Wardrobe page: list of posts by the type of clothes
Notification: Notification Main Page
Settings Page: Terms/Condition, Privacy Policy, Change Password, Sign Out
Sign-Up Page: 6 User sign-up pages
Login-Page: Social Login, Main Login
```

## Next Step

- Build 15 mobile apps for the next 5 years to improve my Django, React, JavaScript, Python skills.

- Experience with a scalable systems with Chef, Jenkins, and Docker. I think DevOps is like a magic.

- Learn more about low-level system design stuff: RPC, Load Balancer and so on. I know how it works, but I want to know the details.

- I think I should start Median. I just made an account: https://medium.com/@johnbaek
